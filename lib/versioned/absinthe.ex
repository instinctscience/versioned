  Declare an object, versioned compliment, and interface, based off name `name`.

  The caller should `use Absinthe.Schema.Notation` as here we return code
  which invokes its `object` macro.

  Both objects belong to an interface which encompasses the common fields.
  All common fields (except `:id` and `:inserted_at`) are included under an
  interface, named by the entity name and suffixed `_base`.

  The generated object will have the following fields:

  * `:id` - ID of the record.
  * `:version_id` - ID of the most recent record's version.
  * `:inserted_at` - Timestamp when the record was created.
  * `:updated_at` - Timestamp when the record was last updated.
  * Additionally, all fields declared in the block.

  The generated version object will have the following fields:

  * `:id` - ID of the version record.
  * `:foo_id` - If the entity was `:foo`, then this would be the id of the main
    record for which this version is based.
  * `:is_deleted` - Boolean indicating if the record was deleted as of this version.
  * `:inserted_at` - Timestamp when the version record was created.
    Additionally, all fields declared in the block.
